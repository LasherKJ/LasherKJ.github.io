            <h1 id="the-bumpass---the-simplest-navigational-device">The Bumpass - the simplest navigational device</h1>
<p>The core idea of the Bumpass is also where the idea for the name came from: it&rsquo;s a bad compass. I wanted to make a navigation device as simple as possible while still being usefull. Across all iterations the story is the same: pick a destination and the Bumpass points you to it. Where a compass points north, the bumpass points to where you want to be. There is no map, there is no turn-by-turn, or traffic reports. It literally just points you in the right direction and the rest is up to you.</p>
<p>The Bumpass takes your location in latitude and longitude, and heading and compares that to the latitude and longitude of your destination. What it returns to you is a direction and distance left to travel.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Bumpass was born out of what we called a &ldquo;Top Gear Special&rdquo; at one of my previous jobs. Our boss was going on vacation and we had no projects coming down the pipeline. Our boss didn&rsquo;t want to: A) pay us to do nothing while she went on vacation, B) force us all to take a vacation at the same time. So instead we were all given a small budget and told we had two weeks to learn a new skill and build something. Much like BBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top Gear&rdquo;, these were goofy, slapdash projects thrown together quickly and then just as quickly shelved.</p>
<p>Except I kept coming back to the Bumpass. Every year or so when I had a little more free time than usual I would pick it up and it would morph into a new form, but never quite reaching what I would call a finished state</p>

<p>The very first form of the Bumpass was a rush job. Any time I had a bug that was just outside my reach or couldn&rsquo;t come up with a way to implement a solution it was set easiest to just ignore it. I only had two weeks and this was more about trying new things than making a finished project.</p>
<p>The first problem was trigonometry. Well actually the problem was me and that I&rsquo;m bad at trigonometry. It turns out that finding distance and direction on the surface of a globe is a bit more complex than algebra can handle. Luckily the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine Formula</a> exists, and my brother who is good at math was able to help me translate it into python.</p>
<p>The second problem was hardware. I had no way to send inputs to the Raspberry Pi once it was running, and adding a keyboard and mouse to the device kind of ruins the whole portability aspect. I decided to look into using bluetooth to send a latitude and longitude object from an iPhone to Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately this derailed version 0. In order to accomplish that I would need to create an app for the iPhone, manage the bluetooth on the phone, manage the bluetooth from raspbian on the Raspberry Pi, and pass it to the python script running the Bumpass scripts. Way too much to sort out in the few days I had left.</p>
<p>So ultimately when the Bumpass v0 was shelved I had a cardboard box that pointed to my favorite mexican restaurant. Which ultimately was not a bad thing to own.</p>
